# How My Personality Shapes the Way I Play and Work

The first assignment in my portfolio class is a self-assessment, taking into account one’s personality and how it aligns with career goals. I thought it would be nice to share my own results as an example; but honestly, this exercise is also a great way for me to reflect on my traits and how they influence my work and interests.

My **16Personalities** result identifies me as an **ENTJ (Commander)**. This isn’t much of a surprise; I’ve consistently received this type on various personality surveys over the years. I suspect it stems from being the oldest of five children. From a very young age, I often found myself in charge, responsible for helping organize my siblings and guiding them through all kinds of situations. That early experience likely shaped my natural leadership tendencies, my strategic thinking, and my desire to see plans through to completion.

Similarly, my **Quantic Gamer Motivation Profile** identifies me as a **Bounty Hunter**, a solo, action-oriented explorer who enjoys discovery, progression, and winning. Again, this aligns with my competitive nature. Growing up in a large family, I became accustomed to direct communication and teasing (especially with my three sisters). We were brutally honest with each other: *“That outfit makes you look like a fool!”* While I am aware of emotions and consider them, most of my decision-making is logical. I naturally seek the easiest, most efficient, and practical ways to get things done, and I tend to weigh decisions carefully, relying on credible sources before acting.

Creativity has always been a part of who I am. As a child, I wanted to be a writer, though my dad encouraged me to pursue computers. I still generate a lot of creative ideas, and while I hope to write one of my novels one day, for now, I’m channeling that creativity into my textbook and teaching.

## Gaming and Career Alignment

When it comes to games, I enjoy clear objectives and goals that allow me to measure progress and success. I prefer exploration and discovery within structured systems rather than the randomness of large multiplayer games—unless I’m playing with a small group of friends (ideally ones I can beat).

In terms of career, while I love teaching computer simulation and gaming, if I were to work in the industry, I’d likely be best suited for **gameplay programming** or **level design**. I’m very critical of my modeling skills, so environmental art isn’t my strength, but I thrive on designing interactions and programming how elements respond to one another. This aligns closely with my ENTJ personality, which thrives on strategic thinking, organizing complex systems, and turning ideas into actionable plans—skills essential for creating engaging game mechanics. My Bounty Hunter gamer type also reflects my preference for exploration, autonomy, and clear goals, which fits perfectly with designing levels and systems where players can discover, experiment, and progress. These roles leverage both my logical, efficiency-focused mindset and my enjoyment of action-oriented, goal-driven gameplay.

Reflecting on these results has reinforced my understanding of how my personality shapes the way I work, play, and think about my career. It’s a helpful reminder that our traits, preferences, and motivations aren’t just abstract concepts; they directly influence the kinds of work we enjoy and the ways we approach challenges.

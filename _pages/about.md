Hi, I’m **Akram Taghavi-Burris**, an award-winning designer, writer, and educator—and a self-described **Master of Systems Sorcery**—dedicated to inspiring others to *Get Creative Today*. 

I serve as the **Program Director and Instructional Associate Professor** of Computer Simulation and Gaming (CSG) at the University of Tulsa, where I lead a curriculum focused on game design, systems thinking, and immersive technologies.

### 🔮 The Philosophy of Systems Sorcery
I define my work as weaving the impossible creations of the imagination into real-time experiences—controlling the entropy of virtual worlds through programming and modular design. My goal is to help students not just build games, but to **architect dynamic, interactive systems** that combine mechanics, player interaction, balance, and emergence into meaningful experiences.

### 🎓 Education & Expertise
With an M.Ed. in Adult Education and over 15 years of experience designing and teaching courses, I specialize in:
* **Game Design & Development** (Unity Education Ambassador)
* **XR (Extended Reality)** & Immersive Tech
* **AI-Driven Simulations** & Digital Twin Systems
* **Modular Programming** & Systems Thinking

I love exploring how technology, creativity, and systems thinking intersect—and helping students do the same.

### 📜 Professional Contributions
I am active in the global research and development community, serving on committees and presenting at conferences such as:
* **IEEE** (Digital Twin & Parallel Intelligence, WIE, ORSS)
* **IGDA** (International Game Developers Association)
* **ACM SIGGRAPH** (Special Interst Group in Graphpics)

### 🏆 Recognition
I aim to empower the next generation of designers to merge imagination with technical mastery. My work has been honored with:
* **Kermit E. Brown Teaching Excellence Award** (2025)
* **Davinci Fellows Award** for Innovation in Teaching
* **American Advertising Federation** Awards

Welcome to my little world, in which I invite you to: 
- Learn moe about who is this **[Master of Systems Sorcery](/about/)**?
- Step inside to browse through my **[Portfolio of Conjurings](/portfolio/)** - projects, experiments, and creations from my explorations in design, games, and digital media.
- Peer into my **[Journal of Insights](/posts/)**, where I share reflections on pedagogy and the philosophy of play.
